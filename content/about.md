**Hello!**

My name is Zhou Fang (方舟) and I work as a Data Analysis Engineer at Micron where I strive to improving our semiconductor wafer yield and fabrication efficiency through extracting insights from the vast amount of data that we collect in the process of manufacturing. I go by Joe, since that's how my first name 舟 is pronounced in Mandarin.

I travelled to Italy to complete my Bachelor's degree and later I finished my Master's Degree in New York, with my engineering backgrouds and my passion for sports, I came to realize of the insurmountable value in using statistical analysis and data science to extract insights, especially in the modern era where we are rapidly increasing the rate at which data is being collected everywhere we look - such as in sports, semiconductor and automotive industries. 

I love using the R language, enjoyed its many statistical and data munging packages, and the vibrant Rstat community. I dab with other programming languages too such as Python for the vast amount of machine learning libraries available and for the the ease of use when I'm aiming at implementing my code at scale. To me the programming language is simply a means to an end and I always remind myself to keep an open-mindedness to find the best tools available whenever I have a task at hand. Some of my favorite people that I follow are Hadley Wickham, Guido, Raymond Hettinger ('there's gotta be a better way!'),  David Beazley, Ken Jee (strongly recommended for anyone who's into DS in the field of sport analytics), David Robinson and Julia Silge(some of the best Tidy-Tuesdays).

I spend most of my time off work with my family and my golden retriever Ollie, and following my passion for soccer and golf, I support Chelsea FC (London is Blue!) and my favorite golfers are Tiger Woods and Collin Morikawa.

If my blog has helped you, you can buy me a coffee on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/fjoe88).
