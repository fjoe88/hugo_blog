**Hi!**

My name is Zhou Fang (方舟) and I am a Data Analysis Engineer at Micron where I work on improving our semiconductor wafer yield and fabrication efficiency through extracting insights from data. My first name 舟 is pronounced exactly the same as Joe hence I go by it as well.   


I love using the R language, enjoyed its many statistical and data munging packages, and the vibrant R community. I dab with Python too and mostly for its machine learning libraries. I love sports, primarily soccer, and have supported Chelsea FC since when I was 10 (London is Blue!). I studied Automotive Engineering in Turin (Italy) I moved to the United States in 2011 and finished my MS in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University in the city of New York.


I live in Lehi, UT, with my wife and my golden retriever - Ollie!
