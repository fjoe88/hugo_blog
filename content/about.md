**Hello!**

My name is Zhou Fang (方舟) and I am a Data Analysis Engineer at Micron where I work on improving our semiconductor wafer yield and fabrication efficiency through extracting insights from data. I go by Joe, since that's how my first name 舟 is pronounced in Mandarin.

I studied Automotive Engineering in Turin (Italy) and later finished my Master's Degree in New York. I love using the R language, enjoyed its many statistical and data munging packages, and the vibrant Rstat community. I dab with other programming languages too such as Python for the vast amount of machine learning libraries available. Some of my favorite people that I follow are Raymond Hettinger ('there's gotta be a better way!'), Hadley Wickham(the 'Hadleyverse'), Guido(Benevolent dictator for life), David Beazley(if you love the Python language for its language), David Robinson(some of the best Tidy-Tuesdays), and Julia Silge(the other some of the best Tidy-Tuesdays, and Tidymodels, and she is awesome).

I spend most of my time off work with my family and my golden retriever Ollie, and following my passion for soccer and golf, I support Chelsea FC (London is Blue!) and my favorite golfers are Tiger Woods and Collin Morikawa.

If my blog has helped you, you can buy me a coffee on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/fjoe88).
