Golf is one of the sport that I picked up during the pandemic (like many others as I start to find out), and now deeply addicted to and can only see myself playing as long as I am physically capable.

Here is one of my iron swing at a local driving range taken last weekend.

Ok, here is how my swing looks like (on a good day) at the beginning of 2021.

As the journey continues for me to find more consistency and power, here I'll try to sum up what I've learned in the past 9 months time from never stepping foot on a golf course or a practice range.

- The sport of golf is not for the faint of heart, that being said - it is truly addictive and fascinating especially for anyone who enjoys *self-improvement through learning, thinking and practicing*.

- *Stance and posture* are very, very important, something I've come to realize 6 months into my journey to pure my golf shotm, unfortunately. I always have the tendency to sit deep and consciously bend my knees that on video turns out to be way more exaggerated than what I felt. To get to a more ideal stance and posture (for me), i always started off with a straight up stance and start tilting my upper body altogether to almost falling over without any conscious effort to bend my knees as I have the tendency to over bend them. In terms of stance, I am taking advice from Collin through an article on Golf Digest where he discussed that he prefers a more narrower stance (shoulder width with a mid-iron), typically a wider stance will restrict hip rotations which is key to shallow the downswing, add power and consistency, and all other goodness.

- *Mike Bender*, through recommendation from a friend I started to follow @mikebendergolf on IG and one of his key teaching is to release, or 'dump' in his words, at post impact. I cannot describe how much this swing thought served me in getting better at swinging a golf club, it helped me to create lag in my downswing, shallow my swing path, improve my tempo, and cure my tendency to over back swing and go cross-the-line.

- *Find a teacher, or record yourself at practice range*. It is often the case that what you feel when swinging a club is not matching up to what is actually happening, and only by looking at the video in retrospective will help you realize what is happening and where to improve. Tiger Woods once in a Taylormade produced video with Collin Morikawa mentioned that he used to see people mentioning that they feel like they are shallowing the club but in reality all he see is a steep swing path.

- *Practice, practice, practice*. Practice is a must to build muscle memory, but also like many pros and teachers would say - *mindless practice can do more harm than good*. I find myself more productive when trying to work on just one aspect at a time instead of constantly changing and searching for ways to correct or improve my swings whenever I'm at a practice range. Often times I also find that focusing on one particular club (an 8 iron for me most of the times) will be more effective way to practice, switching out many clubs in one session will kill the energy fast and bring frustrations when your swing thought of the day did not come to fruition.

- Maintain a closed club face throughout the back-swing the best I could so to avoid never-ending slicing of the ball, as well as adding consistency since by maintaining a closed club face one must maintain the lead wrist position from cupping. Some PGA tour pros such as Collin Morikawa or Dustin Johnson would even go as far to add lead wrist rotation so to have an aggressively closed club face at the top of their back swings.

- *Weight shift*, like *clearing of the hip*, is always mentioned as a key aspect, however it is not something I tend to think about a lot at practice, and it is one of the swing thought that is difficult to grasp and do correct especially when deliberately trying to work on. At the beginning I always tend to shift my weight way too much onto my lead foot(left) which led to an unnatural swing. One key drill that I found helpful is taught by Danny Maude (YouTube) which is a relaxed, athletic swings and not thinking about where the ball would end up - swing the club in pendulum motion back and forth and take advantage of the moment of inertia to begin the back swing, through this practice my body is naturally adapted to how the sequence should be and a natural shift of weight to my trailing foot (idealy only slightly for stability and consistency reasons) instead of my lead foot will happen.
