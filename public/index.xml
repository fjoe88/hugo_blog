My first name 舟 is pronounced exactly the same as Joe hence I go by it as well.&lt;/h4&gt;

I dab with Python too and mostly for its machine learning libraries. I love sports, primarily soccer, and have supported Chelsea FC since when I was 10 (London is Blue!). I studied Automotive Engineering in Turin (Italy) I moved to the United States in 2011 and finished my MS in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University in the city of New York.&lt;/h4&gt;
